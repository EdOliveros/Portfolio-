            My name is <strong>Ed Oliveros</strong>. My journey in programming
            began just over a year ago, driven by an insatiable curiosity about
            how technology shapes our world. Since then, I have immersed myself
            in <strong>web development</strong>, learning something new every
            day.
        </p>

        <p class="text-pretty">
            I have had the pleasure of working on projects such as <strong
                >Eukariae App</strong
            > and <strong>Primordial App</strong>, where I have honed my skills
            in both frontend and backend development. I am passionate about
            creating <strong>intuitive, fast, and accessible</strong> interfaces that
            improve people's lives.
        </p>

        <p class="text-pretty">
            As a developer, my focus is not only on writing code, but on <strong
                >solving complex problems</strong
            > creatively. I am always looking for the next big challenge that allows
            me to continue growing and adding value to the technological ecosystem.
